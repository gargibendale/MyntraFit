# MyntraFit

An outfit recommendation app that suggests a personalized outfit to the user. Upon selecting topwear, the user will be recommended bottomwear, footwear and accessories to go with it! The dataset and python code can be found in the model folder of the repository.

Through this project, I was able to improve my **Firebase** skills, as well as learn the importance of efficiency at **data collection, cleaning and preprocessing**. I started by collecting the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset), merged the required dataframes, handled missing, null values and removed duplicates. Then I proceeded to apply feature engineering to transform the data into the way my application required it. The final dataset is [here](https://github.com/gargibendale/MyntraFit/tree/master/model).

I integrated the app with firebase to fetch data in real-time and to authenticate users using email and password. I also incorporated `shared preferences ` to enable the feature where once the user logs in, they'll not be logged out unless they choose to do so.

[birnaleriya](https://github.com/birnaleriya) and [varshagujrathi](https://github.com/VarshaGujrathi) designed the home page for the app.
